I have uploaded the dataset used in the code to my Floydhub for easy downloading. Find it here: https://www.floydhub.com/mirantha/datasets/celeba

### Instruction to sun the sript

Download the dataset from the provided link and save the images to a folder named 'data_face' in the same directory as the script

Create another foler in the same directory named 'output_images' to store the generated images

Run the script
# GAN
